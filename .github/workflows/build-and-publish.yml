name: Build and push workload image

# This workflow builds and pushes the workload image to GHCR to avoid
# rebuilding the expensive Maven/BenchBase compilation in every CI run.
# The workload image contains the compiled BenchBase benchmark suite
# which takes several minutes to build from source.
#
# Note: The :latest tag is overwritten by any branch push to allow
# feature branch development. Drawback: :latest may not always point
# to the main branch version, but this is unlikely to cause issues
# since workload changes are infrequent.
